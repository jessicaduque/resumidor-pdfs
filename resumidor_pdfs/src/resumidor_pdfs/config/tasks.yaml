analyze_task:
  description: >
    Your purpose is to analyze the recieved text and see if it has more than around 1000 words.
    If it does, separate the text in different sections of approximately 1000 words and store it
    in the output list.
    If it doesn't, since the text is too short, just put all the raw and unmodified text in one string in the list.
    When storing a section, if there are an unecessary amount of extra spaces, you may remove those spaces from that section.
    Remember, each section is simply a part of the raw original text.
  expected_output: >
    A TextSections that contains a list with strings that contain the sections of raw text sections
    from the recieved text that were subdivided.
